# Exoplanet Project

This is a repository for exoplanet data reduction tools and data analysis I have 
been working with. The respository consists mainly of analysis of UVES data of Hot Jupiter 
exoplanets, but will hopefully include other types of data soon. The objective is to recreate 
results from previous publications, in order to understand the basics of data reduction and 
image calibration.
More to follow soon. Any help/advice is much appreciated - I am relatively new
to data reduction and image calibration within astrophysics; I graduated in Physics/Astrophysics,
yet currently do not have a post graduate position - I do this in my spare time 
without funding or supervision.
