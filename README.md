# Exoplanet_Research

This is a repository for exoplanet data reduction tools and data analysis I have 
been working with. The respository consists mainly of analysis of UVES data of Hot Jupiter 
exoplanets, recreating results from previous publications - everything from initial 
data reduction with esorex pipelines for data reduction to data analysis of 1d spectra; 
scripts that work with .fits files to extract keywords from headers, scripts that work 
with esorex command line pipeline recipes for initial data reduction and image calibration 
and extraction of 1d spectra, and some scripts that combine spectra into an image, analysis 
of sky conditions. More to follow. Any help/advice is much appreciated - I am relatively a 
novice in data reduction and exoplanet research, and I do this in my spare time without funding.
